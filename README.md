## Hey y'all!

I'm currently a senior undergraduate student at Arkansas Tech University. I'm majoring phyiscs, math, and vocal music, but I try to study just about everything I find interesting! That includes physics, mathematics, bioinformatics, molecular dynamics simulation, music theory, piano, and really anything cool that I can find time to devote to.
I hope to pursue theoretical/computational biophysics in graduate school.
I'm using GitHub primarily for version control of some personal projects and documents.
